# CS370 – Software Engineering Notes  
## Chapter 1: Introduction

### Objectives
- Define **software engineering** and its importance.  
- Recognize different types of software systems require different techniques.  
- Understand **ethical/professional issues** in software engineering.  
- Review four **case studies** used throughout the book.

### 1.1 Professional Software Development
- **Software Engineering**:  
  - Engineering discipline covering all aspects of software production: **specification → development → validation → evolution**.  
  - Concerned with teams, processes, and long-term maintenance (not just individual coding).  

- **Software = programs + documentation + configuration data**.  

- **Types of software products**:  
  - **Generic products** → stand-alone, sold on market (e.g., word processors, games).  
  - **Customized software** → developed for a specific client (e.g., air traffic control).  
  - **Hybrid approach** common (e.g., ERP systems).  

- **Attributes of good software**:  
  - Acceptability (usable, understandable, compatible).  
  - Dependability & Security (reliable, safe, secure).  
  - Efficiency (uses resources well).  
  - Maintainability (can evolve as needs change).  

- **Key Challenges**:  
  - Heterogeneity → systems must work across diverse platforms.  
  - Rapid Business/Social Change → demand for fast delivery.  
  - Security & Trust → protect against malicious use.  
  - Scale → from small embedded systems to Internet-scale systems.  

- **Software Engineering vs. Computer Science**:  
  - CS = theory & fundamentals.  
  - SE = practicalities of building/delivering systems.  

- **Software Engineering vs. Systems Engineering**:  
  - Systems Eng. = hardware + software + processes.  
  - SE is a subset.

### 1.2 Software Engineering Ethics
- Software engineers must act ethically:  
  - **Confidentiality** → respect client/employer info.  
  - **Competence** → do not misrepresent ability.  
  - **Intellectual Property** → respect copyrights, patents.  
  - **Computer Misuse** → don’t exploit skills for harm.  

- **ACM/IEEE Code of Ethics (8 Principles)**:  
  1. Public interest.  
  2. Client & employer interest.  
  3. Product quality.  
  4. Integrity/judgment.  
  5. Ethical management.  
  6. Advance the profession.  
  7. Support colleagues.  
  8. Lifelong learning & ethical practice.  

- Engineers face **ethical dilemmas** (e.g., unsafe systems, military projects, confidentiality vs. public safety).

### 1.3 Case Studies (Used Throughout Book)
1. **Insulin Pump (Embedded System)**  
   - Safety-critical, controls insulin delivery.  
   - Requirements: availability & reliability.  

2. **Mentcare (Information System for Mental Health Care)**  
   - Patient data management, reporting, monitoring.  
   - Challenges: privacy, legal compliance, safety-critical decisions.  

3. **Wilderness Weather Station (Sensor-Based System)**  
   - Collects & processes environmental data.  
   - Must be reliable & maintainable under harsh conditions.  

4. **iLearn (Digital Learning Environment / Support Environment)**  
   - Provides tools for education & learning.  
   - Similar to integrated programming environments.

### Key Takeaways
- SE is essential for modern infrastructure, business, and daily life.  
- Different systems need different engineering methods.  
- Ethics and professional responsibility are **core to the discipline**.  
- Case studies illustrate diverse software contexts (embedded, info systems, sensors, support tools).
